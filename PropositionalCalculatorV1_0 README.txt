This .zip archive entitled “PropositionalCalculatorV1_0.zip” was created by/for:
    Created by:    Kenneth Chin
    For:           Professor David Keil, of Framingham State University's "Analysis of Algorithms" course as a programing exercise.
    Permitted Use: May be used as a teaching tool for Computer Science classes at Framingham State University and/or courses taught by Professor David Keil.
                   The contents of these files may be modified, as necessary, by the above parties as long as such modifications are noted in the file/source code.
                   The PropositionalCalculatorV1_0 program is not to be publicly published without the author's consent.
    Purpose:       Determine a propositional logic expression's truth value and satisfiability.
    Functions:     The PropositionalCalculatorV1_0 program is uses the JAVA console to obtain a propositional logic expression from the user.
                   Once obtained, all variables are parsed. The user is then prompted to enter boolean values for each variable.
                   The program then determines the expression's truth value based on the variable values given by the user.
                   After obtaining a truth value, the user is offered the chance to determine the expression's satisfiability.
                   If appropriate, the expression's satisfiability is printed and the user is given the opportunity to enter a new expression or quit.
                   At any expression prompt, the user may opt to quit or view instructions.
    How to run:    Use JAVA's command prompt or a JAVA IDE to compile the program and run the "PropCalcMain.java" file.

    Additional Notes: Several test classes have been included in the PropositionalCalculatorV1_0 package. These classes are provided
                      so that students and/or professors can see how each class is intened to work. No comments are given in these classes.
                      The test classes include:
                                          -ConsoleUITester.java    : Tests ConsoleUI.java and prints the HashMap mapping of each variable
                                                                     obtained from the user.
                                          -DisAssemblerTest.java   : Tests ExpressionDisAssembler.java and prints the ExpressionCard binary tree
                                                                     that is created from a given expression.
                                          -EvaluatorTest.java      : Tests ExpressionEvaluator.java and prints the truth value of the given
                                                                     expression and variable values.
                                          SatisfiabilityTester.java: Tests SatisfiabilityCalculator.java and prints all HashMap mappings
                                                                     that satisfy the given expression.
